# Acorn

![Acorn](./acorn-graphic.jpg)

Minimal Creative Coding with a set of opinionated environments.

1. Choose an environments (i.e. 2d, 3d, animation, interactive, music)
    - Some commands become available, a standard set are always available
2. Write Script
3. Iterate and enjoy!

## Manifesto

Creative coding should be about exploring ideas in computation, not about tripping over tools.
Just the essence of the idea (or close to it as possible)

## Environments 

At the beginning of your script, select an environment and set its options.
Environments give you script more features and functionality.
They are also in charge of setting up variables and function calls behind the scenes.
Also, a core set of robust commands exist on all environmentes (worth memorizing)

### Goals

* Easy to integrate into HTML
* Hostable anywhere with sufficient resources (web browser, app, desktop, rPi)


### Anti-Goals

* JS NPM package
* Requires 3rd party packages
* Web only


## Neat features to Add

1. Shortcut key to popup environment docs (current available commands)
2. Save as image / video
3. Input controls
X. Flush out more environments and their spec
